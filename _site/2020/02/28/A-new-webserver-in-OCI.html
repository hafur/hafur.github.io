    <p>As mentioned in the previous post, I will try to get my homepage set up on a webserver running on a virtual machine with in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Oracle is offering an ‘Always free’ account which comes with 2 VMs, a couple of databases and some other services. Interestingly, I can also get a Load Balancer which could help setting up some HA approaches by distributing the web server over two VMs.
But first things first: Lets start with one VM first</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of tutorials out there which describe how to set up a VM in OCI. It is no rocket science whatsoever. You need a Virtual Cloud Network (which can be set up automatically during the provisioning of the VM) and of you go. 
One thing to note though: I have used my own ssh key in the configuration process and did not opt for the option where Oracle provide</p>

<p>Let me give you an idea of what my OCI webserver comprises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</li>
  <li>nginx (I only knew Apache so nginx is a new experience)</li>
  <li>Let’s encrypyt SSL certificate via Certbot</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty minimalist, I reckon. 
I will not go into details on how to set up all of that: Google is your friend. There is a ton of tutorials out there and all of the above is really straight forward.
The only thing that kept me busy for while was the security of this darn thing. I actually should not complain. Oracle claims that OCI is ‘secure by default’ and that is actually true. 
As part of their virtual cloud networking, Oracle provides a Network Security List to configure ingress and egress traffic to and from your services that are deployed in a particular Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). 
For my use case I require a rule that allows incoming traffic on TCP port 80 and 443. Really easy to set up as a matter of fact.
This is what the rule table looks like after I added my rules for port 80 and 443:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nsl.png" alt="My NSL" /></p>

<p>Excited about how fast everything was set up and configured, I threw my shiny, new public IP at my browser of choice just to be completely shattered.
It did not work. I was expecting some default nginx welcome page but my browser would just return errors.</p>

<p>I checked the nginc config on the server, made sure I could do a curl on the localhost. All and everything was working - as long as I was doing the test on the actual server.</p>

<p>It took my some time (mainly because I ignored the documentation - RTFM? No not for me.
Remember: OCI is secure by default. That means that Oracle put an actual firewall on the Ubuntu image. As a matter of fact, every Linux distro you can use to fire up a VMs will have a firewall enabled by default. And the default configuration allows only ssh traffic!</p>

<p>Well - fair enough: I do know Ubuntu Firewall (that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ufw</code> thing). Would have been too easy. In OCI the images come with a proper <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> firewall config - which I do not know.</p>

<p>There is a bunch of information on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> out there. Really! A lot! And I really feel it is a complex topic - naturally security is always a complex topic.</p>

<p>To keep it short - here is the solution (I would not recommend this for a production system):
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo netfilter-persistent save</code></p>

<p>For reference: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/apache-on-ubuntu/01oci-ubuntu-apache-summary.htm">OCI-Ubuntu-Apache Tutorial</a></p>

<p>Horray! It is working!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Webserver.png" alt="OCI webserver architecture" /></p>

<p>Final step: Creating an DNS A-record for the IP address at my domain provider et voila: My homepage is now hosted on an ‘always free’ compute instance n Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>

<p>Now I have to evaluate how robust this solution is.
I figure the main thing to worry about is maintenance of the webserver, i.e. applying patches etc.
We will see…</p>
